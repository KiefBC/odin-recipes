    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 loaf of Italian or French bread</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>4-6 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for topping)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Garlic Butter Mixture:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, minced
            garlic, chopped parsley, and salt. Mix until well combined.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Slice the Bread:</strong> Cut the loaf of bread in half horizontally. Spread the garlic butter
            mixture evenly over the cut sides of the bread.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the bread halves on a baking sheet, cut side up, and bake in the preheated oven
            for 10-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden and crispy.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Optional Broil:</strong> For a more golden top, you can broil the bread for an additional 1-2
            minutes, but keep a close eye on it to prevent burning.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from the oven and, if desired, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese. Slice
            and serve warm.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Note:</em> For a spicy kick, you can add some red pepper flakes to the garlic butter mixture. If you prefer
        softer garlic bread, wrap the buttered bread in aluminum foil before baking.</p>
