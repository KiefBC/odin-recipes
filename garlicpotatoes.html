    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6-8 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil the Potatoes:</strong> Place the diced potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add a
            pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are tender but not mushy, about 10-15 minutes.
            Drain the potatoes and set aside.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Garlic:</strong> In a large skillet, melt the butter or heat the olive oil over medium
            heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until it's fragrant but not browned, about 1-2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Season:</strong> Add the boiled potatoes to the skillet. Toss them gently with the
            garlic until they're well coated. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> If desired, sprinkle the garlic potatoes with freshly chopped parsley
            before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Note:</em> For an added touch, you can sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top before serving. You can
        also roast the garlic in advance for a deeper flavor.</p>
