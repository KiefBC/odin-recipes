    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Poached eggs are eggs that have been cooked by gently simmering them in water. The yolk remains soft and runny,
        while the white is fully set but tender. They're a delicious and healthy way to enjoy eggs, often served on
        toast or as part of a salad or breakfast dish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh eggs (as many as you'd like to poach)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons of white vinegar (optional, but it can help the egg white coagulate more easily)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste (optional)</li>
        <li>Pepper, to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Water:</strong> Fill a deep skillet or wide saucepan with water until it's about 2/3
            full. Add the vinegar (if using). Bring the water to a gentle simmer over medium heat. You want to see small
            bubbles on the bottom and sides, but the water should not be boiling.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Crack the Egg:</strong> Crack your egg into a small bowl or ramekin. This makes it easier to slide
            the egg into the water gently.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Poach the Egg:</strong> Once the water is simmering, use a spoon to create a gentle whirlpool in the
            pan. Carefully slide the egg from the bowl into the center of the whirlpool. This helps the egg white wrap
            around the yolk.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Let the egg poach for about 3-4 minutes for a soft, runny yolk. If you prefer a
            firmer yolk, you can let it cook for an additional minute or two.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Remove and Drain:</strong> Using a slotted spoon, gently lift the poached egg out of the water and
            let any excess water drain off.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Transfer the egg to a plate or toast, then season with salt and pepper if desired.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Enjoy your poached egg as is, or with your favorite accompaniments!</li>
    </ol>
